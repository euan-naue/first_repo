This report documents my first attempts of using Git and GitHub to version control on RStudio project. I will be modifying this report, staging and committing changes and then pushing to GitHub.

Let's create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph).

```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance (miles)")
```

A summary of the data frame is given below:

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
